# 🧠 Curious Collector

An autonomous AI agent that roams the web finding genuinely interesting things — then saves them with AI-generated insights.

## The Idea

Every day, this agent:
1. Searches the web for unusual, surprising, or noteworthy content
2. Fetches and analyzes the most interesting finds
3. Saves them to a curated collection with summaries
4. Generates a "daily discovery" digest

## What Makes It Different

- Not news aggregation (that's everywhere)
- Not "AI slop" generation
- Finds genuinely weird, obscure, or delightful things
- Human-curated taste + AI scale

## Examples of What It Finds

- Obscure GitHub repos with <100 stars that are amazing
- Random internet gems buried in forums
- Interesting research papers
- Creative coding projects
- Weird APIs
- Forgotten internet history
- Niche tools that deserve attention

## Tech Stack

- OpenClaw for orchestration
- Web search + fetch for discovery
- LLM for analysis & summarization
- Markdown/JSON storage

## Output

Daily digest saved to `discoveries/` with:
- Title & URL
- Why it's interesting (AI-generated)
- Category tags
- "Wow factor" rating
