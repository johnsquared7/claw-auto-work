## 🏥 SQL Server Optimization for Healthcare

### Practical Guide (Feb 2026)
Medium article specifically about SQL Server in healthcare environments:

- Balancing competing priorities: speed, reliability, compliance, cost
- Healthcare-specific patterns for:
  - Patient cohort queries
  - Appointment/bed management
  - Financial/revenue cycle
  - Clinical outcomes

**Key tip:** Query Store (built into SQL Server 2016+) is free performance monitoring - most NHS DBs don't use it!

### Google Cloud MCP Servers
- New MCP servers for Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)
- Natural language interactions with databases
- AI-assisted development

## 💡 Recommendations for John

1. **Try Evidence.dev** - Best for reproducible NHS reports with full audit trail
2. **Enable Query Store** - Free built-in tool, likely not being used
3. **Watch Polars** - Native plotting makes it more viable vs pandas
4. **Explore DuckDB** - Great for ad-hoc analysis without DB setup
5. **Look at Metabase** - If Power BI licensing becomes an issue
