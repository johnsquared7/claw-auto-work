# Curious Collector — Daily Discoveries

*Autonomous web discovery focused on John's NHS analyst workflow (SQL + Power BI + Python automation).*

---

## 2026-02-28 — Discovery #1

### 📓 marimo (Reactive Python notebooks that run as apps)

**URL:** https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo

**What’s unique:**
- Notebooks are stored as plain `.py` files (Git-friendly, easier code review than `.ipynb`).
- Reactive dependency graph removes stale-cell chaos from Jupyter workflows.
- Native SQL + app deployment path means one artifact can be analysis notebook **and** lightweight internal report app.

**Why this matters for NHS workflow:**
Can replace ad-hoc Jupyter notebooks with reproducible Python analysis that analysts can schedule, version, and ship to teammates without standing up full BI infrastructure.

**Category:** Python for Data Analysis / Report Automation
**Adoption friction:** Medium (new notebook paradigm, but Python-native)

## 2026-02-28 — Discovery #2

### 🧱 Lightdash (Open-source BI on top of dbt semantic definitions)

**URL:** https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash

**What’s unique:**
- Metrics/dimensions are defined in YAML in the data project (version-controlled semantics).
- Built-in drill-through, lineage, scheduled delivery, and CI-oriented workflow.
- Explicitly designed to avoid metric drift across teams (“single definition” analytics).

**Why this matters for NHS workflow:**
Strong Power BI alternative when metric consistency is the pain point. Particularly useful if SQL transformations are maturing and you want governed self-serve dashboards without vendor lock-in.

**Category:** Power BI Alternatives / Semantic Layer
**Adoption friction:** Medium-High (best with dbt-style modeling discipline)

## 2026-02-28 — Discovery #3

### 🧠 SQLGlot (Programmatic SQL parser/transpiler/optimizer in Python)

**URL:** https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot

**What’s unique:**
- Pure Python parser + optimizer + transpiler across many SQL dialects.
- Supports AST introspection/diff/lineage workflows (not just SQL formatting).
- Useful for building custom query quality checks and migration tooling.

**Why this matters for NHS workflow:**
For analysts juggling multiple SQL environments, SQLGlot can automate query linting/rewrite checks, catch dialect pitfalls early, and generate lineage-like dependency outputs for safer reporting pipelines.

**Category:** SQL Optimization / Developer Tooling
**Adoption friction:** Medium (requires Python scripting, but no heavy infra)

## 2026-02-28 — Discovery #4

### 🧾 Quarto parameterized reporting (one notebook → many tailored PDFs)

**URL:** https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2025-07-24-parameterized-reports-python/index.html

**What’s unique:**
- First-party pattern for generating many custom reports from one Python template.
- Turn hardcoded values into parameters, then batch-render outputs automatically.
- Excellent fit for “same report structure, many teams/sites/ICS areas.”

**Why this matters for NHS workflow:**
If stakeholders still want static deliverables (PDF/HTML), this is a direct path to automated monthly packs without manually duplicating notebooks or Power BI pages.

**Category:** Report Automation / Python
**Adoption friction:** Low-Medium (simple to start, easy to script)

## 2026-02-28 — Discovery #5

### 🏥 NHSBSA EPD transition: old dataset retired, SNOMED version is now the canonical path

**URLs:**
- Retired dataset notice: https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/english-prescribing-data-epd
- Current SNOMED dataset: https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/english-prescribing-dataset-epd-with-snomed-code

**What’s unique / critical:**
- As of Sep 2025, the non-SNOMED EPD path is retired.
- The SNOMED-coded dataset is the ongoing publication stream.

**Why this matters for NHS workflow:**
Any existing Python/SQL ingestion jobs still pointing at the retired EPD endpoint need migration checks, schema validation, and codebook updates now — otherwise report pipelines can silently stale out.

**Category:** NHS Data Pipeline Risk / SQL + Python Maintenance
**Adoption friction:** Low for awareness, Medium for migration/testing

## 2026-02-28 — Discovery #6

### 🦆 Evidence + DuckDB pattern (BI-as-code with SQL + Markdown)

**URL:** https://motherduck.com/blog/the-future-of-bi-bi-as-code-duckdb-impact/

**What’s unique:**
- BI pages authored as code (Markdown + SQL), not click-heavy dashboards.
- DuckDB-backed workflows make local/prototyping analytics fast and cheap.
- Strong fit for report-like analytics where transparency and versioning matter.

**Why this matters for NHS workflow:**
Good option for narrative reporting and analyst-owned “explainable dashboards” where reproducibility and peer review are more important than drag-and-drop UX.

**Category:** Power BI Alternative / Report Automation
**Adoption friction:** Medium (requires code-first mindset)

## Best Bet to Pilot Next Week (1-hour proof-of-concept)

1. Build one parameterized Quarto report from an existing recurring NHS SQL extract.
2. Render for 3 different org/site parameters.
3. Compare analyst time vs current manual export workflow.

If this works, pair it with marimo for interactive drill-down and keep Lightdash/Evidence as medium-term BI architecture options.
