*Autonomous discovery cycle for John's NHS analyst workflow*

## Why These Matter

Focusing on tools that can replace or augment Power BI, speed up pandas workflows, and automate NHS reporting.

---

## 1. Polars — The Fast pandas Replacement

**What:** Rust-based DataFrame library, 10x-50x faster than pandas on large datasets

**Why interesting:**
- Lazy + eager execution modes
- Native SQL queries on DataFrames
- Better memory efficiency for NHS-sized data (thousands to millions of rows)
- Python API nearly identical to pandas

**Use case for John:** Replacing slow pandas transforms on large waiting list or appointment data

**Link:** https://www.pola.rs/

---

## 2. DuckDB — SQL Inside Python

**What:** In-process analytical database, runs inside Python or as CLI

**Why interesting:**
- `SELECT * FROM pandas_df` — query pandas DataFrames directly with SQL
- Columnar-vectorized engine, blazing fast for aggregations
- No server setup — single binary, zero dependencies
- Reads CSV, Parquet, JSON natively

**Use case for John:** Running complex SQL on extracted NHS data without spinning up a database

**Link:** https://duckdb.org/

---

## 3. ydata-profiling (formerly pandas-profiling)

**What:** Auto-generates comprehensive EDA reports from any DataFrame

**Why interesting:**
- One line of code → full HTML report with correlations, missing values, distributions
- NHS data often has missing codes, demographic patterns — this surfaces them instantly
- Export to HTML/PDF for stakeholder sharing

**Use case for John:** Quick data quality checks on new NHS datasets

**Link:** https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling

---

## 4. Evidence — Notebook-First BI from Markdown

**What:** Open source BI tool where reports = Markdown + SQL queries

**Why interesting:**
- Write reports in Markdown with embedded SQL
- Version control friendly (it's just Markdown files)
- Renders to static HTML or interactive dashboards
- No drag-and-drop — code-driven, reproducible

**Use case for John:** Replacing repetitive Power BI exports with version-controlled SQL reports

---

## 5. Lightdash — dbt-Native Open Source BI

**What:** BI layer built on top of dbt (data build tool)

**Why interesting:**
- If John adopts dbt for NHS data transformations, Lightdash is the natural visualization layer
- Semantic layer built-in (metrics, dimensions)
- Self-hosted, no per-user licensing

**Use case for John:** Teams already using dbt for NHS data pipelines

**Link:** https://lightdash.com/

---

## 6. EverSQL — AI SQL Optimizer

**What:** AI-powered query optimizer for PostgreSQL and MySQL

**Why interesting:**
- Paste slow query → get rewritten version with index suggestions
- Free tier for basic optimization
- Shows execution plan differences

**Use case for John:** Optimizing complex NHS Trust queries

**Link:** https://www.eversql.com/

---

## 7. SQLAI.ai — Free AI SQL Optimizer

**What:** Free online SQL optimization tool using LLMs

**Why interesting:**
- No signup required for basic use
- Supports query rewriting and index recommendations
- Works with EXPLAIN ANALYSE output

**Link:** https://www.sqlai.ai/sql-optimizer

---

## 8. NHSX Open Analytics Template

**What:** NHS.UK themed template for open analytics projects

**Why interesting:**
- Python + Plotly + GitHub Pages
- Pre-built NHS styling (accessible, compliant)
- GitHub Actions for automated rebuilds

**Use case for John:** Quick internal NHS dashboards with proper theming

**Link:** https://github.com/nhsx/open-analytics-template

---

## 9. NHSDigital GitHub Organisation

**What:** Official NHS Digital open-source repos

**Why interesting:**
- Real NHS analytics code examples
- Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) templates
- Python packages for NHS data work

**Key repos:**
- `NHSDigital/data-analytics-services`
- `nhsx/open-analytics-template`

**Link:** https://github.com/nhsdigital

---

## 10. FlowForma — No-Code NHS Process Automation

**What:** No-code platform used within NHS for forms, approvals, workflows

**Why interesting:**
- Used by NHS trusts for incident reporting, clinical safety checks
- No IT department needed
- Integrates with existing NHS systems

**Link:** https://www.flowforma.com/digital-transformation-nhs
