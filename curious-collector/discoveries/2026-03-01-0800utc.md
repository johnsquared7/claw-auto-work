*Autonomous discovery cycle for John's NHS analyst workflow*

## Focus: Python Data Analysis Beyond the Basics + NHS-Specific Resources

Previous discoveries covered Polars, DuckDB, Evidence, Lightdash. These are complementary niche tools that didn't make the previous cut.

---

## 1. Great Tables — Beautiful Tables, Python-Native

**What:** Posit library for publication-quality tables from pandas/Polars DataFrames

**Why interesting:**
- Method chaining API (like dplyr but for tables)
- Built-in formatting: currency, percentages, dates, scientific notation
- **Nanoplots** — mini sparklines inside table cells
- Export to HTML, LaTeX, PNG, or RTF
- Works with Quarto and Shiny for Python

**Use case for John:** Professional NHS reports with formatted tables and inline trends (e.g., waiting list volumes with sparklines)

---

## 2. Vaex — Billion-Row DataFrames on a Laptop

**What:** Out-of-core lazy DataFrame library — datasets larger than RAM handled via memory mapping

**Why interesting:**
- Works with datasets that don't fit in memory (billions of rows on a laptop)
- Lazy evaluation — filters/aggregations don't execute until needed
- Pandas-like API — low migration effort
- Fast aggregations via efficient C++ backend

**Use case for John:** Large historical waiting list data or combined trust datasets that choke pandas

**Link:** https://vaex.io/

---

## 3. Pandera — Type-Safe Data Validation for Pandas

**What:** Statistical data validation library bringing schema validation to pandas DataFrames

**Why interesting:**
- Define schemas with expected types, ranges, statistical properties
- Informative error messages when validation fails
- Supports hypothesis testing within pipeline
- Integrates with pandantic for enterprise use

**Use case for John:** Validating incoming NHS data extracts — catch missing IDs, out-of-range clinical codes before analysis

**Link:** https://pandera.readthedocs.io/

---

## 4. D-Tale — GUI for Pandas Without the Boilerplate

**What:** Interactive web interface for exploring pandas DataFrames

**Why interesting:**
- Point-and-click sorting, filtering, exploration
- Built-in charts (histograms, correlations) without code
- Data cleaning, outlier detection via GUI
- Export generated code for reproducibility

**Use case for John:** Quick visual exploration of new NHS datasets before writing analysis code

**Link:** https://github.com/man-group/dtale

---

## 5. cuDF — GPU Acceleration for pandas

**What:** NVIDIA RAPIDS library — pandas-like API but GPU-powered

**Why interesting:**
- 50-100x speedups for groupby, join, filter operations
- Drop-in replacement for pandas with minimal code changes
- Integrates with full RAPIDS ecosystem (cuML for ML)

**Use case for John:** If John has NVIDIA GPU (or access to GPU instance) — accelerates heavy transforms

**Link:** https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/

---

## 6. ITables — Interactive Jupyter Tables

**What:** Pandas DataFrames rendered as interactive DataTables in Jupyter

**Why interesting:**
- Search, sort, paginate without leaving notebook
- Handles large DataFrames efficiently (renders visible rows only)
- One import transforms all DataFrame displays

**Use case for John:** Notebook-first analysis — quick data browsing without print() debugging

**Link:** https://pypi.org/project/itables/

---

## 7. NHS Python Community (nhs-pycom.net)

**What:** Official NHS community championing Python in healthcare

**Why interesting:**
- Open source project between NHS Python Community and Google Health
- Real NHS analytics code examples
- Streamlit-based mapping tools for health geography
- Community of practice for NHS analysts

**Key repo:** `nhs-pycom/nhs_time_of_travel` (collaboration with Google Health)

**Link:** https://nhs-pycom.net/

---

## 8. NHSDigital Data Analytics Services

**What:** Official NHS Digital open-source analytics repos

**Why interesting:**
- Real production NHS analytics code
- Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) templates
- Python packages for NHS data work

**Notable repos:**
- `NHSDigital/codonPython` — reduces barrier for new NHS analysts
- `NHSDigital/artificial-data-generator` — synthetic NHS data for testing
- `NHSDigital/medicines-text-mining-tool` — NLP for prescribing data

**Link:** https://github.com/NHSDigital/data-analytics-services

---

## 9. WeasyPrint — HTML to PDF for Reports

**What:** CSS-powered PDF generation from HTML

**Why interesting:**
- Write reports in HTML/CSS (more familiar than ReportLab)
- NHS styling via CSS
- Full page layout control
- Alternative to wkhtmltopdf (more maintained)

**Use case for John:** Programmatic NHS PDF reports with proper styling

**Link:** https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/

---

## 10. SQLGlot — Pure Python SQL Parser and Transpiler

**What:** SQL parser that can translate between database dialects

**Why interesting:**
- Parse, optimize, and transpile SQL across dialects
- Explain query execution plans
- Build SQL programmatically
- Lightweight, no dependencies

**Use case for John:** Converting queries between NHS database systems or optimising complex queries

**Link:** https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot

## Summary for John's Workflow

| Area | Top Pick | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Beautiful tables | **Great Tables** | Nanoplots, professional export |
| Big data (beyond RAM) | **Vaex** | Billion rows on laptop |
| Data validation | **Pandera** | Catch bad NHS data early |
| Interactive EDA | **D-Tale** | GUI exploration without code |
| GPU acceleration | **cuDF** | If NVIDIA available |
| Notebook tables | **ITables** | Interactive without exports |
| NHS community | **nhs-pycom.net** | Real NHS Python code |
| NHS repos | **NHSDigital** | Official templates/examples |
| PDF reports | **WeasyPrint** | CSS → NHS-styled PDFs |
| SQL tooling | **SQLGlot** | Cross-dialect SQL |

---

## Additional Notes

- **Combine Great Tables + WeasyPrint** for end-to-end PDF report generation from pandas data
- **Vaex + Pandera** = scalable NHS pipeline: handle large data, validate at entry points
- **D-Tale for EDA** → move to **Great Tables** for final stakeholder tables
