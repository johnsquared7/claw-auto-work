## 1. NHS Digital Open Source Analytics — Goldmine 🔥

**URL:** https://github.com/NHSDigital/data-analytics-services

Official NHS Digital's analytics team has published numerous open-source projects:

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **codonPython** | Reduce barriers for new NHS Digital analysts — beginner-friendly Python |
| **Artificial Data Generator** | Generate anonymous synthetic NHS data in Databricks |
| **DNAttend** | ML framework for predicting patient non-attendance (DNA) |
| **Forecasting** | Collection of forecasting methods for different NHS scenarios |
| **SynPath** | Agent-based patient pathway generator |
| **MultiNet** | Morbidity network analysis with community detection |

**Why it matters:** These are production-grade tools from NHS England's own data science team — directly applicable to NHS workflows.

## 2. xlwings — Python ↔ Excel Bridge

**URL:** https://www.xlwings.org/

Unlike other Python-Excel libraries (openpyxl, pandas), xlwings is unique:

- ** bidirectional:** Control Excel from Python OR call Python from Excel
- **Live calculations:** Python functions inside Excel formulas
- **Works on Windows, macOS, Excel web**
- **Already used in production:** Saves healthcare analysts 1-2 days/month on manual data feeds

**Why it matters:** For NHS analysts who live in Excel — this bridges Python's power with Excel workflows without forcing a full switch.

```python
# Example: Call Python from Excel
=Python("my_module.my_function", A1, B1)
```

## 3. NHS-R plotthedots — SPC in Python 🔥

**URL:** https://github.com/nhs-pycom/nhspy-plotthedots

Python implementation of **NHS-R Community's `NHSRplotthedots`** package for Statistical Process Control (SPC).

- Supports NHSE/I "Making Data Count" programme
- Helps identify process variation in healthcare metrics
- Used for quality improvement dashboards

**Why it matters:** SPC is fundamental to NHS quality improvement — this brings it to Python pipelines.

## 4. HES (Hospital Episode Statistics) Data Package

**From:** https://github.com/topics/healthcare-analysis

Contains Python functions specifically for:
- **Rectifying overlapping hospital episodes** (common issue causing under/over counting)
- **Episode adjacency analysis**
- Built with pandas and dask for large-scale processing

**Why it matters:** If John works with HES data, this package solves a known pain point.

## 5. AI SQL Optimization — 2026 State of Play

**Key tools emerging in 2026:**

| Tool | What makes it different |
|------|------------------------|
| **EverSQL** | Index recommendations, schema change suggestions |
| **Aiven AI** | Query diffs showing before/after, index creation scripts |
| **SQLAI.ai** | Free tier, supports multiple database engines |

**The 2026 trend:** AI optimizers now analyze query logic (join types, subqueries, aggregation strategy) not just indexes.

**Why it matters:** Can achieve 5-10x query performance gains without manual tuning — huge for slow NHS monthly reports.

## 6. Evidence.dev — Markdown-Based Reporting

**URL:** https://evidence.dev/

A newer approach to BI/reporting:
- Write reports in Markdown with SQL queries
- Generates static sites from data
- Version control friendly
- Good for reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP)

**Why it matters:** If John values reproducibility and wants to move beyond Excel/Power BI — this is a modern alternative.

## Quick Recommendations

1. **Explore NHS Digital's codonPython** — designed for new NHS analysts, good starter code
2. **Try xlwings** for Excel workflows where you need Python's power but can't abandon Excel
3. **Look at HES package** if working with hospital episode data
4. **Test AI SQL optimizers** on your slowest queries (free tiers available)
5. **Consider Evidence.dev** if interested in Markdown-based reproducible reports
