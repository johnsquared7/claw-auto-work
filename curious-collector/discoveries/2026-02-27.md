### 🌙 Apollo 11 Guidance Computer Source Code

**URL:** https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11

**Why it's amazing:**
The actual source code that took humans to the Moon. Digitized from paper printouts. Contains comments like "BURN_BABY_BURN" and "THEY GAVE US A SHIP". Over 100K stars but still a hidden gem — most people don't realize you can read the exact code that ran the Apollo missions.

### 🎭 GLWTPL (Good Luck With That Public License)

**URL:** https://github.com/distributeaid/GLWTPL

**Why it's amazing:**
A satirical "open source license" that explicitly states: "THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY... YOU ARE COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN." It's a joke that became unexpectedly popular — ironic commentary on permissive licenses.
