## 🔥 Key Findings

### 1. NHS MHSMS Analysis - Direct Python Library for NHS Mental Health Data
A GitHub repo specifically for parsing NHS Mental Health Services Monthly Statistics:
- **Repo:** https://github.com/harrymd/MHSMS_analysis
- **Uses:** matplotlib, numpy, pandas, xarray, scipy
- **Why it matters:** Direct Python tooling for NHS mental health data - rare to find NHS-specific Python packages

### 2. i2b2-GUI - Automatic SQL Generation for Health Data
The i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) query tool:
- Uses star-schema to automatically generate SQL
- Lower requirement for SQL familiarity
- Advanced SQL generation compared to IDE snippets
- Paper: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9306316/
- **Why it matters:** Could speed up complex health data queries without manual SQL writing

### 3. SQL Server Partitioning for Healthcare (Feb 2026)
A practical guide specifically for healthcare SQL Server optimization:
- **Key finding:** Partition elimination reduces data scanned by 90%+
- Recent data (most accessed) isolated in smaller partitions
- Queries for last 30 days ignore years of historical data
- Individual partition index rebuilds (minutes vs hours)
- **URL:** https://medium.com/@srikanth5b9/sql-server-performance-optimization-for-healthcare-systems-a-practical-guide-1a1df70a0c7b
- **Why it matters:** Critical for NHS systems with years of patient history

### 5. time_bucket() for Healthcare Time Series
LearnSQL.com article on healthcare SQL workflows:
- `time_bucket()` optimized for time series efficiency
- Critical for real-time patient vital signs
- **Why it matters:** More efficient than standard date functions for NHS waiting list/appointment analysis

---

### 6. Healthcare SQL with Window Functions
Research paper on advanced SQL techniques for healthcare:
- JOINs, subqueries, window functions (RANK(), etc.)
- Use cases: predictive analytics, cohort analysis, operational improvement
- **URL:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/386270305
- **Why it matters:** Modern SQL patterns directly applicable to NHS analytics

---

### 7. simpy-Streamlit for Health Simulation
Building discrete event simulation (DES) models in Python + Streamlit:
- **Repo:** https://github.com/health-data-science-OR/simpy-streamlit-tutorial
- Health-specific OR (operational research) tutorials
- **Why it matters:** Resource planning, patient flow modeling for NHS
