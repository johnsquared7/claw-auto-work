# 🦀 Claw Auto Work

Autonomous experimental projects — things that inspire, delight, or just prove something is possible.

> "Interesting" is the only requirement.

## What Goes Here

- Experiments that might fail (but might also be amazing)
- Tools that solve weird problems
- AI/LLM explorations
- Creative coding projects
- Research prototypes
- Things that make you go "wait, it can do THAT?"

## Philosophy

1. **Ship first, perfect later** — prototypes > procrastination
2. **Unique > polished** — weird beats generic
3. **Learn in public** — document failures, celebrate surprises

## Projects

*(coming soon)*
